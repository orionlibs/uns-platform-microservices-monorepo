Make MQTT payload to be JSON

create class TagHistorianUpdater in the tags project. This uses CoreTagDataDAO. It subscribes to MQTT's all topics. When it receives a payload, it stores it to the historian

create TagRealtimeDataUpdater class in the tag project. It subscribes to MQTT's all topics to be notified of new data and updates the realtime tag table

create TagRealtimeDataCacheUpdater class in the tag project. It subscribes to MQTT's all topics to be notified of new data and updates the tag cache. See how I can efficiently add a new tag to a TreeNode

Trigger functions when SCADA receives certain data from MQTT. Create a rules engine and a GUI rules configurator

Find all places where we save, update or delete anything from the tag data latest DAO and use MQTT there to notify the tag cache
